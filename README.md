| `/edit-profile`   | `EditProfile.jsx` | Update profile details and upload files |

---

## API Integration

All API requests use Axios with a dynamic `VITE_BACKEND_URL`.

```js
axios.post(`${import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL}/api/auth/register`, payload);
```

> Ensure CORS is enabled on the backend for development and production.

---

## File Upload Flow

### Avatar Upload

- Avatar files are uploaded via `form-data` to `/api/profile/upload-avatar`
- Preview and update profile image instantly

### Document Uploads

- Up to 5 PDF/DOCX files supported via `/api/profile/documents`
- Visual tags added to display uploaded filenames

---

## Testing (Manual)

Use browser devtools or Postman to:

- Inspect API responses for registration and verification
- Confirm JWT tokens are stored (via cookies or localStorage)
- Check document/avatar upload size and MIME type restrictions

---

## Deployment

Frontend is Vite-powered and optimized for deployment on platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **Render**.

> For Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy `/dist` folder
```

Ensure correct `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is set in Vercel Environment Settings.
